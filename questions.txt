Am just thinking about their original queries. If the model is trained on the transactions, customers and the attributes.
For example:
Do customers buy Overheads with Valves:
e.g How many orders of overhead showers are placed WITHOUT shower valves ?
We’d be looking for the number of Order numbers that have Overheads in the order, but no shower valves.
we would want to know what product is on each order, BUT – we will also have to take into account whether the same account buys certain items separately.
e.g. They buy the shower valve in bulk, but they buy the shower heads individually?

How many orders of hand showers / slide rail kits are placed WITHOUT a shower valve ?
How many orders of hand showers / slide rail kits are placed WITH MATCHING SHAPED shower valves ? (Exposed / Concealed) This seems a strange request but there is a very firm opinion that matching the shape of valves to showers is a big deal. We don’t actually know that it is !!

We might have to index the transactions, the order numbers and the customers, or we might already have done so.
